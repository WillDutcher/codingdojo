I had climbed all over many fiberflass boats in my search for a perfect design, when one day I stumbled upon Renn Tolman's book, A Skiff for All Seasons, How to Build an Alaskan Skiff (boat plans in book form). I was smitten. I started out by building saw horses, and finally the transom of the boat so I could get an idea of scale. Fast forward to 2005, when I completed the boat, or as Renn would say, call the build good enough and go fishing. During this time I had my first child, Eleanor, and I weathered through a bout of Lymphoma. ",
