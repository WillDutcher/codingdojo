Solo Project - Paolo's Pizzaria

I want to create a simple web application for a pizza restaurant. Ideally, an MVP would consist of:

Server: 
	- Backend consist of MOngoose, Node, Express
	- Database consists of order information including:
		Order:
			Pizza:
				Size, Crust, Cheese, Sauce, Toppings
			Sides:
				Breadsticks, Cheesesticks
			Desserts:
				Tiramasu, Canoli
			Drinks:
				Selection of brand-name beverages
Client:
	Create Order form with menu items described above
	Edit order
	Review order
	Delete order

Challenges will include:
	Adding a User registration/login to front/back end
	Adding ability to save a favorite order to the user
