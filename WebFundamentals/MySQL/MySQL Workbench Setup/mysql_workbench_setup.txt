-- Once you've connected the database, try the queries that would need to make a CRUD

-- INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

-- Show all clients by first and last name
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM clients;

-- INSERT new client (self); satisfies CREATE from CRUD
INSERT INTO clients(first_name, last_name, email, joined_datetime)
VALUES ('Will', 'Dutcher', 'william.c.dutcher@gmail.com', now());

-- Show all clients to ensure new client was added, as appropriate; satisfies READ from CRUD
SELECT *

-- Update first name; satisfies UPDATE from CRUD
UPDATE clients
SET first_name = 'William'
WHERE first_name = 'Will';

-- Show all clients to ensure client was updated, as appropriate
SELECT *

-- Delete created/updated client 'William Dutcher' from the database; satisfies DELETE from CRUD
DELETE FROM clients
